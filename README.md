# Discord.JS Snippets
I made a VSCode extension with [discord.js](//discord.js.org) snippets.  
It's not published yet, so you have to download the [folder](discord-js-snippets) and move it to `[Your username]\.vscode\extensions`.  
Or alternatively you can clone the repo, and move the [discord-js-snippets](discord-js-snippets) folder to `[your username]\.vscode\extensions`
```diff
+ git clone https://github.com/Irian3x3/vscode-djs-snippets.git
```
